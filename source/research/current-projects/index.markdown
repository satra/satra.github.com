## Current Projects

### Realtime fMRI and cognitive training to speed recovery from mild traumatic brain injury - mTBI

PI: John Gabrieli, Robert Van Boven
Funding Source: Department of defense
Collaborators: Brain Plasticity Inc.

The goal is to determine whether cognitive training (in the form of adaptive
games) with or without realtime fMRI-based attention-regulation training
alleviates cognitive deficits in mTBI patients.

### Realtime fMRI and smoking cessation

PI: Eden Evins
Funding Source: NIH
Collaborators: Luke Stoeckel, John Gabrieli, Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli

This project uses realtime fMRI to teach subjects to increase self control by
learning to regulate brain activity in regions involved in inhibitory control.

###High-resolution structural and functional characterization of mTBI
PI: Raul Radovitsky, John Gabrieli, Nancy Kanwisher
Funding Source: Department of defense
Collaborators: Bruce Fischl, Larry Wald

Since the neurophysiological deficits in mTBI are poorly understood, the goal of
this project is to use the latest MRI technologies and functional paradigms to
establish longitudinal differences in brain structure and function in soldiers
with and without mTBI.

###Neuroinformatics cloud-app and federated data sharing
PI: Satrajit Ghosh
Funding Source: INCF
Collaborators: INCF Datasharing taskforce, BIRN, XNAT

The goal of this project is to ensure that scientists have federated access to
data resources in neuroscience and the ability to process these data using
cloud-computing infrastructures and that provenance of data is known.

###Graph-based multimodal representation and multivariate analysis
PI: Arno Klein
Funding Source: NIH

The goal of this collaboration is to establish features from multimodal MRI data
and to collate information in the form of graphs, whose nodes and edges
represent different features (e.g., anatomical or functional region, functional
connectivity, diffusivity, etc.,.).

###Diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction
Collaborators: Arno Klein, John Gabrieli

The goal of this group of projects is to determine biomarkers for refining
diagnosis and for treatment outcome prediction. Current data sets include
subjects with social anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, stuttering and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

###Nipype: A platform for efficient and reproducible neuroimaging analysis
Funding Source: NIH, INCF
Collaborators: NiPy developers

We are part of an opensource effort (NiPy) to create tools for highly efficient
neuroimaging analysis. One component of these tools (NiPyPE) creates a pipelined
environment for integrating different software packages within a unified
umbrella.

###Kinematic and neuroimaging studies of stuttering
PI: Joseph S. Perkell
Funding Source: NIH
Collaborators: Shanqing Cai, Frank Guenther, Deryk Beal, Jason Tourville

The aim of this project is to relate behavioral (both acoustic and kinematic)
and neuroimaging observations from person who stutter (PWS) and persons with
fluent speech (PFS).
